# Radial-Distribution-Function-for-Hard-Sphere-Fluids
This Mathematica notebook gives the equilibrium radial distribution function, g(r), of a hard-sphere fluid at any packing fraction, as obtained from the exact solution of the Percus-Yevick integral equation.
The maximum distance (in units of the sphere diameter) is r=5.
